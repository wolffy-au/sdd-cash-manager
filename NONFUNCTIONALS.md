# Non-Functional Requirements

---

## Categories

---

### Performance

* **Query Response Times:** System queries must meet defined response time targets (e.g., critical queries < 1 minute; API common queries <1s, complex queries <5s).
* **Efficiency Metrics:** System design should facilitate reduction of key metrics related to compliance and user effort.

---

### Security

* **Data Protection:** Sensitive data must be handled according to defined policies, including masking or anonymization before processing by external or high-risk components.
* **Verifiable Attestation:** Critical artifacts or decisions must undergo human review and verifiable attestation using secure cryptographic methods.
* **Authentication:** Authentication must be secured, using industry-standard mechanisms (e.g., secure tokens).
* **Authorization:** Access control must be enforced based on defined policies (e.g., ABAC), integrating with authentication mechanisms.
* **Data Encryption:** Data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
* **Security Assessments:** Regular security assessments, including automated scanning and threat modeling, must be performed.
* **Regulatory Compliance:** System must comply with relevant information security standards and regulations.

---

### Reliability & Availability

* **System Monitoring:** System must provide real-time monitoring of key operational parameters and deviations from expected states.
* **Exception Handling:** System must support controlled exceptions or overrides for critical operations under defined circumstances, with auditability.
* **System Health Checks:** Regular automated checks for system health and configuration consistency are required.
* **Resilience:** System must remain healthy, resilient, and compliant during normal operations and emergency scenarios.
* **API Error Reporting:** API error reporting must be standardized and machine-readable.
* **Operational Resilience:** System must comply with relevant operational resilience standards and regulations.

---

### Usability & Efficiency

* **User Effort Reduction:** System design should minimize user effort and friction for governance-related tasks.
* **Natural Language Querying:** System should support natural language querying for complex data sets where appropriate.
* **Machine-Readable Artifacts:** All system artifacts must be in machine-readable formats.

---

### Compliance

* **Policy Automation:** System must automate enforcement of relevant compliance policies and regulatory standards.
* **Verifiable Attestation:** Critical decisions must undergo verifiable human attestation.
* **Efficiency Metrics:** System design should facilitate reduction of key compliance-related metrics.

---

### Code Quality & Maintainability

* **Code Quality:** Code must be readable, maintainable, and adhere to defined quality standards.
* **Documentation:** Public interfaces must be documented, and documentation must be kept up-to-date.
* **Modularity & Reusability:** Components should be designed for modularity and reusability.
* **API Design:** APIs must follow established conventions (e.g., RESTful principles) and include versioning.

---

### Testing & Quality Assurance

* **Test Coverage:** Test coverage must exceed a defined threshold (e.g., >90%).

---

### Process & Automation

* **Automated Workflows:** Automated processes for building, testing, and deployment (CI/CD) should be implemented.
* **Version Control:** Development must utilize version control with a clear commit strategy.

---

### Error Management & Observability

* **Error Management:** System must provide comprehensive error management capabilities, including standardized responses and robust exception handling.
* **Observability:** System must be observable through mechanisms such as structured logging, metrics collection, and distributed tracing.
