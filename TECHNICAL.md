## Automated Code Uplift and Quality Improvement

The concept of using autonomous agents to uplift code quality and incrementally increase test coverage involves leveraging AI-driven tools and automated processes for iterative improvement. It is designed for an iterative development process where an AI coding assistant works alongside static analysis and test coverage tools.

### Core Concepts

* **Isolated Development Environment**: Employs `git worktree` to establish an isolated branch for modifications, preventing interference with the main codebase. A dedicated Python virtual environment (`venv`) is also established to manage dependencies specifically for this uplift process, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.

* **AI-Assisted Fixing**: Integrates with an AI coding assistant (e.g., Aider) configured for autonomous operations, including auto-accepting suggestions, auto-committing fixes, and performing automated linting and testing. Specific parameters for the AI model must be clearly defined to tailor its interventions effectively.

* **Iterative Static Analysis and Correction**: The core workflow involves:
    1. Running static type checking using a chosen static analysis tool on individual files.
    2. If the static analysis tool reports errors, these are relayed to the AI assistant along with the file path for contextual awareness.
    3. The AI assistant attempts to resolve the reported errors autonomously, applying context-aware recommendations.
    4. Following corrections, the file is re-evaluated using the static analysis tool. This loop continues until the tool reports no errors, ensuring compliance with type safety and quality standards.

* **Incremental Test Coverage Enhancement**: The process consists of:
    1. Evaluating the current state of test coverage within the codebase.
    2. Identifying specific code segments (such as functions, branches, or files) that lack sufficient test coverage.
    3. Generating targeted test cases for these segments, potentially utilizing AI assistance to comprehend code behavior and formulate precise assertions.
    4. Integrating the newly generated tests into the existing test suite and verifying their successful execution to ensure an overall increase in test coverage.

* **Configuration Management**: Specific configuration files are dynamically generated to tailor the AI assistant's behavior, encompassing parameters like the selected AI model and enabling autonomous capabilities. This flexibility allows adaptation to varying project needs and workflows.

* **Outcome Metrics and Considerations**: To gauge the success of this automated process, metrics such as reduced bug counts, improvement in test pass rates, and time savings in code reviews should be established and monitored. Additionally, potential challenges such as dependency conflicts and AI reasoning errors should be anticipated and addressed proactively.

## Error Management

* **Consistent Error Responses**: Define a standard format for API error responses (e.g., JSON structure including error code, message, and details) for predictable client-side handling.
* **Exception Handling**: Implement robust try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions gracefully, preventing application crashes.
* **Meaningful Error Codes**: Utilize standardized HTTP status codes for API errors and define custom error codes for specific application-level issues.

## Observability and Logging

* **Structured Logging**: Implement structured logging (e.g., JSON format) to facilitate easier parsing and analysis of log data.
* **Log Levels**: Utilize standard log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) appropriately to categorize messages.
* **Centralized Logging**: Consider strategies for aggregating logs from different services/components into a central system for monitoring and analysis.
* **Metrics Collection**: Instrument the application to collect key performance indicators (KPIs) and system metrics (e.g., request latency, error rates, resource usage) for monitoring and alerting.
* **Distributed Tracing**: For microservices or complex workflows, implement distributed tracing to track requests across multiple services.

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

* **Automated Pipelines**: Establish CI/CD pipelines for automated building, testing, linting, and deployment.
* **Build Automation**: Ensure consistent and reproducible builds.
* **Automated Testing**: Integrate all automated tests (unit, integration, BDD) into the CI pipeline to run on every commit.
* **Linting and Formatting**: Integrate `Ruff` or similar tools into the pipeline to enforce code style and quality.
* **Deployment Strategy**: Define clear deployment strategies (e.g., blue-green, canary releases) and automate deployment processes where feasible.

## API Design Principles

* **RESTful Conventions**: Adhere to RESTful principles for API design, including resource-based URLs, appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and status codes.
* **API Versioning**: Implement a clear versioning strategy (e.g., URL path versioning) for managing API evolution.
* **Authentication and Authorization**: Define secure mechanisms for authenticating API consumers and authorizing access to resources.
* **Data Validation**: Utilize `Pydantic V2` for request and response data validation to ensure data integrity.
* **State Transition Enforcement**: When designing APIs for entities modeled as FSMs, use Pydantic models to define valid states and enforce transition rules. Prefer action-based endpoints (e.g., `/resource/{id}/action`) that trigger state changes as side-effects, rather than direct state updates, to maintain workflow integrity.

## Software Architectural Patterns

* **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: A common pattern for structuring applications, separating concerns into model (data and business logic), view (UI), and controller (handles input and updates).
* **Two-Tier and Three-Tier Architectures**: Understand and apply standard architectural patterns for client-server applications, separating presentation, application logic, and data management layers as appropriate for the solution.
* **Finite State Machines (FSM)**: Employ FSMs to model entities with distinct states and transitions, ensuring predictable lifecycles, data integrity, and controlled workflows. This pattern is especially useful for entities with complex operational states or governance processes.

## Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

* **Ubiquitous Language**: Establish and use a common language shared by developers and domain experts throughout the project.
* **Bounded Contexts**: Define clear boundaries for different parts of the domain model, managing complexity and allowing for independent evolution.
* **Aggregates and Entities**: Design domain models around aggregates to enforce invariants and manage consistency. FSMs often complement DDD by managing the state of aggregates or entities.

## Utilities and Frameworks

* **Testing Frameworks**: `pytest`, `pytest-mock`, `behave` (for BDD)
* **Linters/Formatters**: `Ruff`
* **Type Checkers**: `MyPy`, `PyRight`
* **Build/Dependency Management**: Prefer `uv` for dependency installation and resolution from `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt`. Use `Poetry` for comprehensive project management tasks such as building and publishing.
* **Package Installation/Running**: `UV`
* **API Framework**: `FastAPI`
* **UI Frameworks**: `Streamlit`, `Chainlit` (for building interactive UIs and LLM-based applications)
* **Messaging/Orchestration**: `CrewAI` (implied by usage context)
* **Utilities for LLM**: `LiteLLM`
* **Data Validation**: `Pydantic V2`
